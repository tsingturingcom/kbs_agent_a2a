项目维护者有责任明确可接受行为的标准，并对任何不可接受行为的实例采取适当和公平的纠正措施。

项目维护者有权利和责任删除、编辑或拒绝不符合本行为准则的评论、提交、代码、wiki编辑、问题和其他贡献，或暂时或永久禁止任何他们认为不适当、威胁、冒犯或有害的其他行为的贡献者。

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 范围 | Scope

本行为准则适用于项目空间内以及个人代表项目或其社区时在公共空间内。代表项目或社区的例子包括使用官方项目电子邮件地址、通过官方社交媒体账户发帖、或在线或线下活动中担任指定代表。项目的代表性可能由项目维护者进一步定义和澄清。

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## 冲突解决 | Conflict Resolution

我们不认为所有冲突都是不好的；健康的辩论和分歧通常会产生积极的结果。然而，不尊重或违反项目行为准则的行为是不可接受的。


We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project's code of conduct.
